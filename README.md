# pyScreen
Create a set of screenshots of two video files to compare the two.

## Prequisites 
You need to have ffmpeg installed AND included in your PATH system variable (if running Windows) or the binary finaly included within where pyScreen.py is stored. I have included a precompiled version of ffmpeg in the repository but it highly recommended to add include the location of ffmpeg to your system variable PATH.

## Install
Download the script and Prequisites if neccessary and simply run python pyScreen.py

## Usage
The script will prompt the user for a location of the Source and then it will prompt the user for the location of the Encode. The script will use ffmpeg to generate 6 screen shots of the Source and 6 screen shots of the Encode video files. The Screen shots are set to generate at the exact some times in each of the files using the following logic: the screen shots start at 10 minutes in for 6 frames with 1 minute apart from each other. The images are saved as .png files labeled as Source-1-[UNIQUENUMBER].png and Encode-1-[UNIQUENUMBER].png. The [UNIQUENUMBER] is used to keep each file from being over written if you plan on saving these screen shots. The Unique Number is generated by measuring the amount of time in seconds that has passed since January 1, 1970 0:0:0 GMT.
